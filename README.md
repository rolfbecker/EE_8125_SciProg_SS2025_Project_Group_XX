# EE_8125_SciProg_SS2025_Project_Group_XX

## General Infos

This small project with three exercises is part of the Scientific Programming Assignment in the summer semester of 2025. Each exercise will be graded for a maximum of 10 points.

1. Due date is **2025-08-31**.
1. You can work in groups of two students or alone.
1. Assign yourself to a [**SciProg SS2025 Moodle Group**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=508771), even if you are working alone. 
1. You can work in **groups of one or two students.**
1. If you are working in a group of two, you may not divide tasks between you! **All group members must be involved in all tasks!** 
1. **Download** (not clone) this git repo, **really unzip** it (right click, extract, ...) and **RENAME the unpacked folder according to your moodle group**, e.g. rename `EE_8125_SciProg_SS2025_Project_Group_XX` to `EE_8125_SciProg_SS2024_Project_Group_C`, if your Moodle group is `C`. 
1. Enter your **matriculation numbers** and short notes of **your contrubutions** into the **headers of each Jupyter notebook.**
1. **Edit the provided Jupyter notebooks** containing the exercises and answer the questions directly in them. Add additional code and markdown cells as needed. It is not necessary to create new notebooks!
1. **Do not use pocket calculators or spreadsheet programs!** Do all your calculations explicitly in the Jupyter notebooks! Otherwise we will deduct points for this. 
1. Just providing code is not enough! **Describe shortly** what you are doing! Use **markdown cells** with **appropriate formatting** (headers, lists, typesetting of equations, etc.) in your Jupyter Notebooks to explain your steps. Use short comments in your code cells, too.
1. **NOT A TASK FOR SS2025:** (Present your work in the form of videos and explain the Jupyter notebooks. Imagine you would present it to other course members. Do NOT take video recordings from your computer screen with your smartphone! Use professional screencast software such as OBS or similar!)
1. After you have completed the tasks, zip the directory with your code and data and [**upload the zip file to Moodle**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/mod/assign/view.php?id=508775).
1. **All group members have to upload** so that the submission can be proven.
